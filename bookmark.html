    <h4 id  ="blabla"> <h2>About this Project</h2>
        Our project focuses on lung infection prediction for COVID-19 patients using advanced machine learning techniques. With the global impact of COVID-19, timely identification of lung infections like pneumonia and tuberculosis is critical for early intervention and better healthcare resource management. By leveraging clinical data, radiological images, and artificial intelligence models, we aim to support healthcare professionals in making accurate and faster diagnostic decisions. Our system has been carefully designed and trained using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for robust classification and reliable results in real-world applications.

    </h4>
    <h4 id  ="yep"> <h2>Models used in Project</h2>
        We have used advanced Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures, including popular frameworks like VGG, ResNet, and DenseNet, fine-tuned for medical imaging classification. The models have been trained on a balanced dataset of chest X-ray images categorized into pneumonia, tuberculosis, and normal cases. Key techniques like transfer learning, data augmentation, hyperparameter tuning, and class activation mapping (CAM) have been implemented to improve model accuracy and interpretability. These models are capable of providing quick, reliable predictions while being integrated into healthcare workflows.</h4>
    
    <h4 id  ="yes"><h2>Images used</h2>
        Our dataset comprises a rich collection of high-quality chest X-ray images categorized into three primary classes: pneumonia, tuberculosis, and normal. Each image is meticulously labeled to ensure model accuracy and reliability. We have used robust data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, zooming, and cropping to enhance the diversity of the dataset. These images not only aid in model training but also serve as visual tools for prediction validation and medical study.
